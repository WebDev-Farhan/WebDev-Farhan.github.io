## 🌟 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Farhan Sadiq, a passionate and creative Developer based in Bangladesh. I love to build new things and I'm on a journey to explore the world of programming.

🚀 In my free time, you can find me solving math problems/reading fictions/developing  something. I believe in  
"Always try try & try  
          And        
Ask why? why? & why?".
